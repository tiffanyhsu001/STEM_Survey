Advisors(stats dept) are not familiar with staff that they should have been familiar with. 

2. They(stats dept) do not care about students enough, especially for those who are not stats major students. 

I had a horrible experience with stats advisors and they delayed my academic progress on stats minor for 2 quarters with both advisors' discrepancy and non-consistency with stats prerequisites classes. I heard many students had same experience of mine in terms of dealing their issues and questions in double or minor major with stats with advisors in stats dept. I even heard the manager of classes(I am not quite sure his title) said "" You'd better declare stats major ASAP, I don't want to see you again"" to a student which I think was pretty rude and discouraging. These words should not come from an educator or even a staff from a university. 

3. Maybe because UCLA has too many students that the class schedule is hard to accommodate all students. 

My sister is also a math and stats student graduating from UC Berkeley. Compared to her experience in UCB, I feel like UCB's registration system is more advanced than ours and UCB provides more flexibility to students to choose classes with their flexible prerequisite class requirement and cross-department classes enrollment. As long as you think you could handle it and the professor is willing to add you into the class, it's no problem to attend higher sequence classes regardless the prerequisite requirement or if it is cross-department/cross-major class which makes students have as many as possibilities to explore and succeed in their college life. 
I don't think UCLA cares about this, the staff just cares about killing the line outside their office and wants you to leave the office with no concern of whether your problem has been solved. 
To further illustrate, I would like to put my case as an example here, I took a stats10 in my community college which UCLA stats dept did not recognize it as equivalent to stats10 here and advisor A here insisted that I have to retake stat10 before taking stat20(where advisor B just manually enrolled my friend who had same situation as mine to a stat20 class, I knew this after the enrolling deadline, if not, I could have just gone to advisor B to have me added to stat20), but when I retook a stat10 here in UCLA, the registrar counted as a repetitive class so gave me zero credits of it. 
The problem exists for years without fixing and the consequence falls on students themselves including me. Because of this, I could not enroll into stat20 in 2018 fall which I should have been able to. In the later winter quarter I found out my stat10 enrollment had no credits so I dropped it with no stat20 provided in that quarter. Even then I went to stats dept, the advisor still did not care and asked me to come back next quarter when stat20 is available. In spring, I went back and the manager of classes did not solve the problem and asked me to consult with registrar why the registrar did not give credits for my stat10 here.  The staff in registrar thought it was wired that they could not do anything to a junior(at that time I was a junior) a repetitive class credits and for stats dept it was an small issue that they could just manually got around this issue and add me to stat20.  
Rather than a call to figure out this problem or even have a meeting to seriously discuss about this issue that many transfer students might have, they just let me went back and forth from the stats dept and Murphy Hall with both parties throwing their ball to the other. This was a very long story and here is just a small piece of it. After this, I felt exhausted and frustrated and do not want to make any contact with any admin staff here in UCLA. 
I have told this story to my sister who had same situation as mine that in her junior year she also needed to work with their stats dept on classes enrollment and double major declaration stuff, she never encountered any unhappiness with their dept over there in UCB and she thought it was unbelievable that our system was so rigid and inflexible because the only way for me to enroll stat20 is to 'beg' the stats dept staff to add me in as our system prevented me from enrolling higher sequence of classes which in UCB system, they won't prevent you from enrolling classes unless you acknowledge that you have full responsibility for your own academic progress and path. At that point, I was so regretful not choosing UCB over UCLA in 2018 as I got both admissions.",Average Value,46.9,66.7,33.3,56.3,75

I've also become very involved with UCLA Hillel and Jewish life on campus. Through this community, I've made so many friendships and connections that I know I will have for the rest of my life. I've grown as a student, a friend and a leader, and I can say with confidence that I wouldn't be doing as well as I am here if it weren't for this incredible community. ","As a STEM major, I sometimes feel that I'm not getting as much support from my professors and TA's as I deserve.  For example, I had a math professor for Linear Algebra who, in many ways, discouraged us from asking questions. When we did ask questions, he often provided a quick one word answer and didn't fully explain his thoughts. This experience made it harder for me to succeed in this class both because it decreased my confidence and because it made it harder for me to receive guidance and feedback. 

Though I've had several STEM professors who are very good, I am aware that STEM professors tend to exhibit this type of behavior more than non-STEM professors. I'm not exactly sure how UCLA could address this issue, but I think it is important for students of all majors to receive the support they deserve.  ",High Value,50,25,66.7,50,58.3

I really enjoyed the experience that I had living in close proximity with my friends and I think I really grew as a person at UCLA - especially socially. My home is about 1 hour away from UCLA, so I had the choice to commute and at first my parents wanted me to commute. I ultimately decided to dorm so I can focus on my studies instead, and I think it was the best decision I've made. 
My brother and sister went to Cal Poly Pomona during their 4 years in college and it was only 15 minutes away from home so they commuted. They had a completely different experience there, and I think the difference was mainly because UCLA has a great culture and I was able to take advantage of this by living at UCLA. I was really able to focus on growing myself academically and socially. In terms of success emotionally, I don't know how I may have grown in that aspect.","The main thing that inhibited my ""success"" (or more like success in growth) at UCLA was always having to worry about my grades. I came into UCLA as a pre-med, and I knew that med schools looked at high GPAs very favorably over lower GPAs so I was always worried about my grades and thus I would just take classes to get the grade and not for the fun of learning. But starting mid-third year, I left the pre-med track and began exploring my own interests by taking classes I've always been interested in. I felt a lot happier since I don't worry about my GPA as much anymore, but I still feel like I can't learn just for the fun of it because there's always the pressure of getting a good grade in class.

This greatly helped me still be able to succeed academically during a time when I was struggling. 

The support of my parents has helped succeed in every way possible at UCLA. I have parents who support my mental health and my education. I am fortunate enough that they can also pay my full college tuition. They are a huge factor in my success here. 

Personal motivation has also been an important factor for success at UCLA. It is such a large campus community that it is easy to just feel like a number, sort of unimportant. One of the biggest things I learned was the need to self-advocate, to speak up for help and opportunities, and to actively participate in groups on campus. This has helped me feel like I belong at UCLA. ","Something specific that I feel has inhibited the success I wanted to have at UCLA has been trying to find undergraduate research experiences in the sciences. As a freshman, I applied to the biomedical research minor after earning an A+ in the preparatory course. I had a 3.9 GPA at the time. I was interviewed but was rejected. I applied twice more after this, and was still rejected. When I asked what could be done to improve my application, I was given generic answers. There was not really a clear explanation for my not getting accepted, despite limited lab space. After this, I struggled to find independent research opportunities with other professors. I tried cold emailing, and talking with professors in office hours. At one point in my junior year, I spoke to a professor about his lab and he said that he would rather accept freshmen because they have more years to spend in the lab, which would make training them worth it. I explained that I had wanted to start research as a freshmen but had struggled to find opportunities. I developed a great relationship with a professor who was not actively doing research, but who recommended me to several of his colleagues, but I was still not able to find an opportunity. I am now in my fourth year. I am disappointed, because I chose UCLA partly because of its reputation for incredible research. I even reached out to the chair of my major department, asking for feedback or advice on finding lab research opportunities, but was not told any information I did not already know or had not already tried. I just feel there was never an answer as to why I was not accepted into the minor, and since then, the challenge of finding a research opportunity has taken a toll on me. 

Personally, mental health issues have been a challenge for me throughout my life, and this continued into college and potentially negatively impacted my academics. However, I felt there were resources available to me that were helpful at UCLA.",High Value,46.9,25,50,81.3,58.3

I never knew people when to SAT bootcamps or all those kinds of things to get into UCLA. There is a lot of economic diversity here, but growing up most of my friends didn't have a car, go to Europe, or any of the things that a lot of people here seem to have experiences with. Essentially most of the people I meet don't really have much in common with me from a background perspective so it's hard to feel like I belong when my life has been completely different from a social, economic, and ethnic-composition perspective. 
A lot of people generalize the ""premed"" process to be brutal and that you need a very well-rounded resume.  It has been really hard with all this pressure as a premed to do research, volunteering, extracurriculars for your resume to med school. I feel so burnt out already and I haven't even applied yet. I applied to several clubs as a sophomore and I got rejected from almost every single one. It's really hard to keep your thoughts positive when you aren't able to gain any experience in a field that is essentially mandatory for you resume.

In that sense, not having a social life was nice because I did not get distracted. I had a few acquaintances from classes, and that helped me not feel completely alone and in my opinion saved me from depression. Towards the end of my first year at UCLA I joined a group here on campus in an effort to put myself out there and it was not bad. I dreaded going back to UCLA for my second year.

Socially and emotionally, I think joining clubs and pushing myself to meet new people on my floor helped a lot. During more challenging and depressive mental periods, I used the CAPS resource center, which helped a bit as well. ","I felt like it was difficult to get involved when I first transferred in. Many organizations are very competitive, and as a result, I feel that many students can struggle to find a place they belong, or acquire access to some of the campuses best resources.  The answer to this problem was to just keep applying, but even then, a student can lose access to valuable resources some clubs tend to have. I think this furthers the notion that a student at a public university is on his/her own, and a result, fostering a more competitive environment. 

Academically, I was always frustrated with discussion and office hours. While some professors/classes put a great emphasis on helping their students, other classes have hundreds of students waiting 20 minutes to ask a professor or TA a question.

When I started at UCLA, I felt an immense pressure like never before to prove to my peers that I’d earned my spot alongside them. As cynical as it may sound to say so, I found that talking to others in class often left me feeling drained and inferior. Pressure for success and perfection is applied as heavily by classmates as parents, professors, and institutions. It’s my third year and I’m only barely feeling as though I have my head above water, and this is only after I’ve made the decision to live off-campus. Distance is what helped me succeed at UCLA; I found that the distractions on campus— whether they took the form of chaotic roommates or unrelentingly perfect classmates— were too much for my mental health. Moving off-campus, into a quiet neighborhood with my partner, has proven invaluable to my ability to succeed academically at UCLA. However, I’ve undoubtedly had to sacrifice my social life as a result of this distance— I’m no longer close (spatially) to my friends, which makes it nearly impossible to ever see each other since we’re all so busy with the demands of school and extracurriculars. 

Ultimately, a bit of separation from campus culture is what I needed to succeed. Academia, especially STEM at UCLA, invites a toxic culture of achievement, comparison, and perfection, that is tangible to all students— but we ignore it, even choosing to participate if it’ll give us an advantage. I need as much distance from that as is reasonably possible. ","I failed my first Chem quiz at UCLA. It was the very first quiz I ever took in college, and I got a 50%. I’d never received a score so low on anything, and I was crushed, turning to my floormates and classmates to complain— and hopefully seek encouragement. I was met with almost satisfied suggestions to drop the course, to change majors, to change life paths. “This is going to be really, really difficult for you if you don’t even understand THAT.” “Are you sure you want to be pre-med?” “You know Chem’s only going to get harder.” Each person I spoke to smiled quietly at my (literal) failure, urging me to give up, convincing me that each test carried the weight of my entire future. I assumed I just had bad luck with floormates, so I started a group chat with a few classmates from my Chem class. One person texted and asked a basic conceptual question, to which another member replied “I can’t answer that. My parents read my messages and will be upset with me if they see I’m helping the competition.” 

At this point, only a few weeks into my freshman year, the toxic culture of UCLA pre-meds was entirely tangible— in fact, it had slapped me in the face. I was dejected. I felt like every person around me saw me as competition, rather than a classmate or peer that they could learn from (and vice versa). The environment that has been cultivated at UCLA, specifically in the STEM department, is absolutely crushing— and no one’s allowed to acknowledge that. If you acknowledge that this is hard, then you’ve lost. It often feels as though the expectation at UCLA is to be perfect, to never fail, to never blink an eye at the overwhelming expectations of classes and extracurriculars— because we’re Bruins, we’re the #1 public university. 

As someone with mental health issues, I’ve often found it detrimental to rise to the occasion. In order to do all that is expected of me, I have to sacrifice my social life, my personality, sleep, eating— school has to be my #1 priority at all times. Lack of routine, especially sleep and meal times, has destabilized my mental health every single quarter. I’m exhausted, and I can’t turn to my peers, because we’re all just supposed to pretend we’re doing fine. The intersection of the toxicity of campus culture and my own personal mental health issues often leaves me feeling at a disadvantage compared to other students (especially when you account for the lack of availability of sufficient psychological and psychiatric care from the University).",High Value,18.8,16.7,69.4,50,66.7

I always have to be cognizant of when the last bus is and decide whether a social gathering is worth me walking home in the dark once I get off the bus. Moreover, at night, the bus has some strange people. One time, I stayed on campus for a club social until 10 pm. When I got on the bus to go back to my apartment, a man sat next to me and asked me questions on where I lived. He tried to lean his head on my shoulder and it made me very uncomfortable.

Male,Computer Science,N/A,"Asian, China",Junior,No,No,3.03,Yes,No,Four year college,Four year college,"I think STEM is just difficult, and my high school did not prepare me well enough for the rigor of college. I didn't experience any academic issues per se, but I was one of the top students in my high school, and never really learned how to study effectively (let alone study at all). Homework and tests just got harder, and I couldn't keep up with them. I underestimated how much time I needed to put into my projects and didn't allocate enough time. I realized that procrastinating is very bad for the time consuming CS projects. Thus, the transition into college was difficult and my grades didn't fare too well. Additionally, the other students in my classes are really smart, so competing with them for grades is challenging. ","Being born in America, I haven't really experienced any cultural or social issues that might have made it challenging. This might sound really weird, but I actually think that because of the privileged situation I was born into, I became lazy. My parents, having immigrated to America, had to work very hard from a young age to help their families survive. I on the other hand, have been very blessed and placed in a financially stable family due to the hard work of my parents. In a sense, I'm spoiled and just never felt the urgency to work hard in school as the fear of not having money or food never isn't real to me. This laziness does actually contribute to my academic performance. It is obviously not proven that my upbringing is the reason why I am so aloof, but this is just my opinion.  Anyway, I feel many students procrastinate and such, but many still have a drive to do well and succeed that leads to action. Me on the other hand, would very much like to do better, but this desire isn't enough to push me to action. I'm okay with the C's that I get though I would like A's and B's. All of this plus poor time management skills plus all of the opportunities to socialize in college just add together to make studying difficult. ","I found a Christian fellowship on campus and the environment has been very welcoming from day one. All the people in the fellowship are extremely nice and have treated me like family. I am welcome in their homes, we study together, eat together, and just live life together. They have been a very influential part of who I am today.   ","I would say that high schools could prepare students better. Obviously, this is out of UCLA's control, and some schools don't have the resources to improve this. Everything I can think of lies in the student's themselves and not on the school, so this is very difficult. I think maybe encourage a mindset of learning rather than getting grades. It's very difficult when the world places so much value on the GPA, but I think this could help students develop a healthier mindset about school. Yeah, I can't think of much. Sorry.

However, I also felt some knowledge we taught in that class required extra physics knowledge which we did not have time to talk explicitly in the class. Also, for me the content of that course is too much to teach in just one quarter. The professor tried his best, but we still kept rushing to the end. Even if the score I get was not bad, I believed that I did not fully understand the content. Many students have the similar feelings in the class. Another big challenge is math.  Most stem courses I took so far are math. I felt I can handle the ordinary lower division math courses, but the honor course and upper division course are difficult and time-consuming. The honor course Math 32BH is extremely challenging for me, because the classmates are very competitive and the content of that course is so much harder than the parallel courses. ","At first I put too much stress on myself and believed I should do well in every math, part of the reason is because I came from China.

At the same time, I worried that whether the courses we taught here were easier than the courses students took in China. I worried whether I could be more competitive than my high school classmates who took math in China.  Now I felt more relaxed and focused more on the knowledge itself to enjoy the math.

My personal experience in UCLA STEM, mostly math classes with some physics and programming,  has been full of discouragement. If I don't get a subject, I feel dumb, but I have to remember that this is the first time I'm seeing this and it isn normal to not understand right away. Like with anything, it takes time and practice to become good at something, time that isn't available in a quarter system. Sometimes there are people who get things right away, and that makes it really difficult for the rest of us. Often I feel like if I had just a little more time I would be able to do much better in my classes. In STEM classes more than any other type of class, your entire grade is based on exams. No other assignments and barely any points for homework. This makes it very difficult for those who struggle with test taking. I have developed test taking anxiety just from attending UCLA. I have never gotten an A in a math class. Mostly B's and some C's. Which makes my STEM GPA very low compared to other majors at UCLA. It is unfortunate that many STEM students will undoubtedly have a lower GPA that north campus majors. ","The best STEM majors are often just focused on school. I prioritize my health, sleep, and well-being ahead of school most of the times. I have to be up very early for rowing team practices. Other people enjoy hanging out with friends and being social at night. It is very difficult to do this as a STEM major.","Professors can make a big difference on this sense of belonging. How they respond to different students, how willing they are to help and make adjustments, and what they expect all cater to different types of students. If a professor doesn't have time for the type of student you are, you feel behind and like you are not supposed to be here.","Many math classes are 3 days a week for 50 minutes. It is hard to digest anything in this time. I would prefer longer classes. More personable TA's. Consistent degrees of exam difficulty among professors (especially professors teaching the same course). BRUINCASTING LECTURES!! Only 1 of my math classes has been bruincasted.

In general, having people to talk to increased my sense of belonging. ","The expectations of STEM classes are higher than in other classes. That increased difficulty can become wearing and isolating. Teacher's have to make sure that students don't become isolated and can continue to enjoy the learning, despite the difficulties inherent in the class. Organizing group work can assist with this, as long as group work is truly done collaboratively. Giving opportunities to make up work that was done poorly so that students don't become so stressed that their grade - and then their GPA and their futures - is going to permanently suffer could help to mitigate the wear. Otherwise, having a close relationship between teacher and student, as well among students, allows students to reach out when they are struggling.

Coming to UCLA, I had to work multiple jobs, deal with a broken skull, and become accustomed to the fast pace environment. I quickly realized that everyone around me was either ""at my level"", or higher. I personally knew people who could call their parents and get academic advice (parents were doctors who received their degrees in the States), others asked for money transferred to their accounts whenever they pleased. Some had connections and were quickly accommodated in research labs/ were able to work in professional settings. It was difficult for me as I didn't have that financial freedom or family members who I could ask for advice. When my first grades weren't as high as I've always been accustomed to, I began to lose self-confidence and doubt myself. It's taken a toll on me because I have been working these past 3 years to build my confidence in myself back up again. What is most heartbreaking for me is that I pour everything I have into my studies and, more often than I'd like, the grades I receive do not reflect my work. I look at other students and they seem to be having a blast/no academic issues/high GPAs. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong, and I really wish I did so I could fix it and be a higher valued student/competitive applicant.","I have been a NASA/outer-space fanatic since I was about 4 years old. Barely understood English but I would watch NASA documentaries day in and day out. Coming to UCLA, I wanted to study Aerospace Engineering. However, being a DACA student, there weren't really any potential job openings in that field for non-citizens. Coming here, I had to work at least 2 jobs, on top of being a full time student because I come from a low socio-economic background and my family was having financial difficulties. At one point, my stress/anxiety was so high, I had to resort to CAPS. Moreover, being a first generation student, the first in both my immediate and extended family to go to college, I didn't have anyone to rely on and had to figure it out on my own (resources/classes/lifestyle). I want to go into the Petroleum Engineering field, and as a first-generation, DACA, Hispanic female I feel that certain jobs like these prioritize males, especially white males.","Belonging: being a part of USP and mentoring through SWE.

For example, in my freshman year I had to take weekly quizzes for my Life Science course.  These quizzes comprised close to 5% of my grade and, objectively, were not a big deal.  However, I sometimes felt intensely anxious when taking them, especially if I thought I performed poorly.  This led to academic struggles in the class.  I felt negatively about my academic performance, even when my weighted grade was high, because these scores were usually lower.  Sometimes this made me not want to do assignments or go to class, but I made myself because I knew these also counted toward my grade.  This anxiety was mostly fueled by rumors about ""weed-out"" STEM classes, which curve down to lower grades.  It turns out that these rumors were mostly incorrect.   Even though the classes were difficult, I performed well and succeeded.","When I was a first-year student, I struggled with being away from home.  I am very close to my family, so living on-campus was a shock for me.  I often felt isolated and had a difficult time making friends.  I sometimes felt looked down upon because I was unsure of my major/career path.  Many of my peers seemed more organized in this sense and aspired to do great things in their life.  I often felt lonely and depressed.  I managed to find a small community for other students like me through the College Honors Program and my classes.  I made friends and pushed myself to make the most of the university.","Being part of a club made me feel like I belonged on campus.  My club visits elementary schools weekly to teach science.  I met some great people and felt that I was making a positive contribution to the community.  On the other hand, living on the Hill made me feel more isolated.  I had a difficult time connecting to people and making friends in such a large community.  I sometimes felt that I was the only person struggling socially, as many people I encountered were always positive and outgoing.","Some ways to improve STEM majors is to focus on holistic learning over ""weeding out"" students in the first year(s).  This would help students adjust and lower stress levels.  Additionally, you could create organizations and communities on-campus for students, including students who do not have definitive post-college plans.  It would be great if there were a general mailing list for STEM majors so we could learn about opportunities outside our individual major.

Initially falling behind in a course starts a positive feedback loop of feeling inept, discouraged, and being afraid of asking basic questions for fear of wasting the professor/TA's time.","Knowing that I'm not alone in whatever I'm struggling with.

It's hard to keep up with the onslaught of information that can be thrown at you when learning about the natural sciences, mathematics, etc., especially in a quarter system. Another issue is the use of STEM-based jargon that is skimmed over or left undefined for the sake of time management for the daily lecture.","It's hard to continuously keep up with the amount of work expected to be done in a STEM based course, granted it's hard in general to really manage any course material given outside of lectures most especially in a 10 week system such as the U.C. system, that also recommends socializing and networking via club activities and volunteer. I think what is significantly harder for STEM based classes is when you spend free time outside of lecture to read the textbook and do the readings before the lecture then show up only to be told relatively the exact same thing as what you already read in the lecture. Granted there is a given opportunity for clarification but at some points it feels like repetition.","Given my choice in majors it's hard at times to feel a sense of belonging as the fields are historically westernized and taught through a eurocentric lens, however the sense of belonging on campus comes from socialization of like minded individuals who have similar experiences to me or come from first generation families, it's these ties that make the campus feel a little less foreign.","1.

Since people that are like me are most likely in their room like I am. However this year i have definitely found a group that has given me a sense of belonging finally. ,Well I am not sure what challenges STEM majors may encounter but something I find helps in any class especially those I am struggling in is creating groups that help each other out when they don't understand something or to check in to see if everyone else is on the same page.  One of the best ways I have found to learn is by explaining a concept to someone else or having a fellow student explain the concept to me; this is because no one else understands the process from not knowing to knowing other than a fellow student who figured it out. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This field also seem very competitive so you feel very high degree of pressure to do well. ,It makes me feel like I do not belong into STEM classes where everybody around me prides themselves on being pre-med and sort of looks down upon me for not being one. ,"Unfortunately, I cannot think of anything...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Female,math/econ,,Asian,Freshman,Yes,No,3.81,No,No,Four year college,Four year college,"Since I want to develop my soft skills about how to communicate with others and how to organize events, being a STEM major may take too much of my time to study instead of doing extracurricular activities. ","Generally, people with STEM major are considered to be nerdy. Being in such a community may not good for my development in soft skills and I may stay in my confront zone of studying.","I think I am lack of a sense of belonging.

Male,Political Science,,Caucasian,Junior,No,No,3.73,Yes,No,Four year college,Four year college,There are a great deal of non-STEM majors that have a lower division statistics course listed as an undergraduate requirement. This means they fill up rather quickly and the course you get isn't necessarily geared toward your area of study.,"Falling behind even slightly in a STEM course basically forces you to make sort of a tactical retreat. If you miss one class, you will probably end up missing more just in an effort to catch up.","Attending professor office hours has given me a sense of belonging on campus. Even if I didn't have specific questions, it was a pleasure. I have found my professors cordial and knowledgeable about current events in their area of study.",I think if you integrated more specialized statistics courses into the undergraduate curriculum that would help redress the issue I outlined in question one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decrease class sizes. Finally, for me as a non-STEM major I think it is really daunting and challenging to have to do things like coding. I am open to it and learning, but a lot of the stats TAs in particular assume we know even the very basics of code like when to use < or what a typical command even is. If courses like stats 10 and other STEM subjects are going to be pre requisites for non-STEM majors then they should be made accessible as such. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Female,Aerospace Engineering,,Caucasian,Senior,No,No,3.2,Yes,No,Four year college,Four year college,"The classes for my major tend to be on the theoretical side, rather than hands on. I've had to spend a lot of time in my extracurriculars relearning material and trying to transfer ideas from theory to practical applications.
I have found my major especially challenging and time consuming, which makes it hard to balance with the rest of my life.","Many of the mentors, advisers, and role models within my field are old, white men. Dealing with these microaggressions from people I am supposed to be able to look up to makes it particularly challenging. There have often been situations in which I have had to make myself deliberately less feminine and change my behavior and appearance to gain their respect or approval. There are other situations in which they have, in trying to be polite, have addressed me in a condescending or demeaning manner, often by commenting on my physical appearance while I am trying to have a technical conversation with them.","I am in an engineering club which has a particularly good mentor. He cares about how I'm doing in my personal and academic life and is always willing to lend an ear or give advice. Perhaps the most valuable aspect of his mentorship is he is very aware of the inequalities minority engineers face and actively attempts to address it. He makes me feel seen by acknowledging when someone has done something sexist, tries to help by connecting me with female mentors in my field, and leverages his position as a male and as a university employee to try to make change. While microaggressions from those in my field make me feel like I do not belong, his efforts create an environment in which I feel a sense of belonging.","Having more resources for minority students would be helpful for many STEM majors. While I have been able to find communities in which I am comfortable as a woman (SWE was not a good fit for me), as an LGBTQ STEM major, I still feel somewhat alienated from both the STEM and LGBTQ community.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, getting help with math problems when taking math classes has been a struggle.","Dealing with emotional health / general well being has made it difficult being a STEM major because I often have to put my grades above my own mental health, which has caused a very stressful two years and I know so many students that have regular mental breakdowns from not being able to have any free time for themselves.","I joined a finance club, Bruin Asset Management, where everyone seemed to be taking similar hard classes and going through the same things. This provided me with support and a sense of belonging since I could relate to everyone.",Better free tutoring services; reduction of grade deflation; a lot of tests are designed for students to fail and then the class is curved up as a whole but this causes unnecessary stress for all the students and a reduction in this would be extremely beneficial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Female,Political Science,,Asian,Sophmore,No,No,3.8,Yes,No,Two year college,Graduate or professional degree,"Although I am not a STEM major currently, I did take 7A and had difficulty with studying for the class. It was very different from other stem classes I had taken in the past because it was not very straightforward, it felt like we were learning bio in a way very particular to only this class.","Similarly, the STEM class, 7A, was difficult because it felt like all my peers were gunner pre-med and that kind of stress did not make it enjoyable to learn for those who just like bio for the sake of bio.","Being part of a club like Daily Bruin helped me feel like a sense of belonging at UCLA. Also, classes were we really get to interact with the other students in the class.","I think helping reduce the culture that everyone in STEM is going to fail and they need to fight with their peers for a spot would help minimize all the stress associated with STEM. Also, just having smaller classes in general. Being in Moore with like 300 students, it's hard to make any connection with the class or professors. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Male,Statistics & Economics,N/A,Caucasian,Sophmore,No,No,3.25,Yes,No,Four year college,Graduate or professional degree,"As a STEM major previously as a chemical engineering major specifically, academic issues that have challenged me include adjusting the to increase of difficulty, time management, and accepting such competitive schemes where test score averages are so low. Mainly, it was difficult to stay motivated when my engineering courses put extreme strain on me and kept me wondering if I would even pass classes when I was already focused on giving my best effort.","As a STEM major, I ran into mental and social issues because I was spending too much time isolated with my work and I began losing the confidence that I could succeed academically as the difficulty increased. As a result, I sunk into what was my worst and least fun quarter at UCLA due to the isolation academics put on me.","Examples of me feeling a sense of belonging to UCLA's campus comes from the community that I feel with people in clubs, close friend-groups, classes, and just from walking and interacting with everyone. The other students here are all faced with a bunch of the same challenges and everyone is here for each other to support and be open about their own struggles.","There are a few effective steps UCLA could take to mitigate the challenges on STEM majors. The first is to fix the scheduling issues that force kids out of classes, or at least with administration being more upfront on planning scheduling for incoming students. My freshman year, I felt misled into taking classes at a rapid pace to avoid falling behind and felt like it was a crisis when I got locked out of half my classes, when really its a normal thing. In addition, I would advise STEM classes, especially for engineers, to stop having lower credit hour totals. Why would the 20 and 30 series physical chemistry have less credit hours than the 14 series biological chemistry when the physical chemistry series is seen as the more difficult one? I see elements of unit shaving for STEM majors so that their majors can be more dense but still not look outrageous when unit counts are compared.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
